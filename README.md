# A350-family-liveries

## Rules
1. Liveries will be stored in this repository. A small number of liveries may be possibly selected to be included with the aircraft.
2. All liveries should be as accurate as possible, within reason, particularly in terms of logos and colours.
3. All liveries must have historically or currently been used on the A350. No fictional liveries will be accepted to the main livery repository. Virtual Airline liveries are one exception, and may be stored in a dedicated part of the repository.
5. We will only have one example of each distinct livery of an airline.
6. Each livery must be created in 4096*4096 resolution. Lower and higher resolution versions may possibly be accepted in addition to the 4K variant.
7. The livery should be of (at the very least) reasonable quality, particularly, the livery should match up at UV boundaries with no mismatching.
8. The description should be in this format: ICAO Airline Name (Extra Info).
9. Liveries will be reviewed by a main contributor before being added.
